# DdbRuby

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add ddb_ruby

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install ddb_ruby

## Usage

This ruby gem is intended to allow reading of DDB JSON in Ruby. This should include characters, monsters, items, and other related things.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

It's going to be a while before I can create characters in DDB that use only SRD rules, so specs are going to be sparse for a bit.
